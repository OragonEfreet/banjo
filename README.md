Banjo API
=========

Banjo is a small projet in making myself a C99 framework for game development.
The work aims at the following objectives:

- *Little to no dependency*: The API must implement everything by itself and rely on the least amount of dependencies. Even the testing framework is local.
- *Simple*: Easy to grasp for newcomers as long as they know C.
- *Self-Documented*: Documentation is fully available from header files, making code API sufficient to learn.
- *Fast compile times*: Banjo **must** compile fast. 

Current status of the projet is _early draft_. I'm currently thinking the API design as well as implementing basic containers.
