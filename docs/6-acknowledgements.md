# Acknowledgements  {#acknowledgements}

I owe the progress of this project some acknowledgements.

## Articles

- [Daniel Hepper](https://epicco.de/), who hosted a [rather convenient 8x8 font](https://github.com/dhepper/font8x8) that I used for built-in font drawing.
- [Juho Snellman](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/about/), who provided a [simple yet efficient implementation for ring buffers](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-12-13-ring-buffers/), which I use for event queues.
- [Wolfgang Drawinger](https://datenwolf.net/), author of [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) that I directly took and adapted for Banjo.

## Books

- [Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/index.html), by [Gabriel Gambetta](https://gabrielgambetta.com/index.html). This book became the starting motivation for making my own 2D renderer.
- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/), by [Patricio Gonzales Vivo](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) and [Jen Lowe](https://www.jenlowe.net/).

## Projects

- [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/) ([zlib](https://www.libsdl.org/license.php)), for the quality of the code that made me understand so many things.
