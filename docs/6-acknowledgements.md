I owe the progress of this project some acknowledgements.

## Articles

- [Daniel Hepper](https://epicco.de/), who hosted a [rather convenient 8x8 font](https://github.com/dhepper/font8x8) that I used for built-in font drawing.
- [Juho Snellman](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/about/), who provided a [simple yet efficient implementation for ring buffers](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-12-13-ring-buffers/), which I use for event queues.
- [Melissa E. O'Neill](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/index.html), wrote [The PCG Paper](https://www.pcg-random.org/paper.html#download-and-read-it).
- [Wolfgang Drawinger](https://datenwolf.net/), author of [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) that I directly took and adapted for Banjo.

## Videos

- [Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK) obviously, the famous channel by Mark Brown.
- [One Lone Coder / javidx9 channel](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9), immensely useful, especially for learning the bases of audio programming.
- Sos Sosowsky presented [Writing an ultra-portable game without using an engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cOqAHzIfQE) at _Game Industry Conference 2023_.
- [Travis Vroman channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TravisVroman), maker of the [Kohi Engine](https://kohiengine.com/).

## Books

- [Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/index.html), by [Gabriel Gambetta](https://gabrielgambetta.com/index.html). This book became the starting motivation for making my own 2D renderer.
- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/), by [Patricio Gonzales Vivo](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) and [Jen Lowe](https://www.jenlowe.net/).
- *Game Physics Engine Development*, by [Ian Millington](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics).

## Projects

- [Kohi Engine](https://kohiengine.com/) ([Apache](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi/blob/main/LICENSE)), by Travis Vroman.
- [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/) ([zlib](https://www.libsdl.org/license.php)), for the quality of the code that made me understand so many things.
